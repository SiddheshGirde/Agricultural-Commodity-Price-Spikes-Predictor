"""
Phase 8 — feature engineering on price_sentiment_merged.csv.

Adds price-derived time-series features and resolves the sentiment-NaN
question flagged at the end of Phase 7. Does NOT generate the spike
target - that's Phase 9, kept separate per the original phase plan.

LEAKAGE RULE (same boundary as the diagram from message one): every
feature for day t uses only rows dated <= t, within that commodity's own
series. Nothing here ever reads price(t+1).

See accompanying notes for why rolling/lag features are trading-day
(row-based) rather than calendar-day, and why sentiment NaNs are imputed
to 0 rather than left missing - both are real modeling decisions with
named trade-offs, not neutral defaults.
