# Agricultural Commodity Price Spike Predictor

NLP-based sentiment analysis of Indian agricultural market news (FinBERT),
combined with historical mandi price data, to predict next-trading-day
price spikes in Onion, Wheat, and Soyabean.

**Academic semester project.** Not a trading tool — see Limitations.

---

## What this actually does

1. Pulls daily wholesale (mandi) prices for Onion (Lasalgaon), Wheat
   (Kanpur Grain), and Soyabean (Indore) — the benchmark market for each
   commodity, from India's Agmarknet dataset.
2. Pulls ~3.8M Indian news headlines (2001–2023), filters to the ~2,000
   that mention these three commodities.
3. Scores each headline's sentiment with FinBERT (`ProsusAI/finbert`),
   with a targeted correction for a confirmed domain-gap bug (see below).
4. Aggregates sentiment to one row per (commodity, date), merges it onto
   the price calendar, engineers rolling/momentum price features.
5. Labels each day: does price rise ≥5% on the *next* trading day?
6. Trains and compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
   per commodity, using a strict chronological (not random) train/test
   split.
7. Explains the winning model with SHAP.
8. Serves everything through a Streamlit dashboard.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # Windows PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` includes `pyarrow` (Parquet support) and `xgboost`
in addition to the original list — both added mid-project when they
were actually needed, not anticipated upfront.

## Data — not included in this repo, download separately

Raw source files are excluded from version control (large, and — for
the news dataset — of uncertain redistribution license). To reproduce
from scratch:

| Data | Source | Place in |
|---|---|---|
| Prices | [Daily Market Prices of Commodity India (2001–2026)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khandelwalmanas/daily-commodity-prices-india), Parquet folder | `Data/parquet/` |
| News | [India News Headlines Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therohk/india-headlines-news-dataset) | `data/raw/news/` |

Everything downstream of these two downloads **is** committed
(`data/interim/*.csv`, `models/*.pkl`) — the full multi-million-row raw
files are not, but every cleaned/aggregated intermediate output is, so
the dashboard and models are usable without re-running the full
pipeline.

## Reproducing the pipeline

Run in order — each stage's output feeds the next:

```bash
python src/preprocessing.py        # Phase 3 - clean price + news, filter to 3 commodities/benchmark markets
python src/sentiment.py            # Phase 5 - FinBERT scoring + price-direction override
python src/aggregate_sentiment.py  # Phase 6 - headline-level -> daily sentiment
python src/merge_price_sentiment.py# Phase 7 - align price calendar with sentiment (has_news flag)
python src/features.py             # Phase 8 - rolling/momentum price features
python src/generate_target.py      # Phase 9 - spike label (t -> t+1, next TRADING day)
python src/train.py                # Phase 10/11 - chronological split, LR/RF/XGBoost comparison
python src/explain.py              # Phase 13 - SHAP feature importance (Random Forest)
streamlit run app.py               # Phase 14 - dashboard
```

## Key design decisions (and why)

- **Trading-day, not calendar-day, semantics throughout.** "Next day"
  means the next day the benchmark market actually reported a price,
  not the next calendar date. Necessary because mandis don't report on
  Sundays/holidays — without this, weekend gaps would either create
  spurious "1-day" spikes or leak information across the gap.
- **One benchmark market per commodity**, not a national average:
  Lasalgaon (Onion), Indore (Soyabean), Kanpur Grain (Wheat) — matches
  how these prices are actually referenced in Indian financial press,
  and avoids the aggregation/weighting complexity of blending thousands
  of mandis with inconsistent reporting.
- **Modeling window: 2013-07-01 to 2023-06-30.** The intersection of
  Soyabean's price data start (2013-07-01, the true binding constraint
  — not Wheat's, which was mistakenly used in an earlier draft of this
  window) and the news dataset's actual end date (2023-06-30, discovered
  during validation — the Kaggle listing's "21 years" claim describes
  the *start* of coverage, not how current it is).
- **Sentiment aggregation**: mean positive/neutral/negative probability
  across a day's articles, dominant label (mode), dispersion (std dev,
  explicit 0 — not NaN — on single-article days), `has_news` flag.
  Zero-news days are NOT filled with a manufactured "neutral" score —
  sentiment columns stay `NaN` until feature engineering, where they're
  imputed to 0 specifically because sklearn's `RandomForestClassifier`
  can't train on `NaN` (XGBoost could have used it natively, but a
  shared feature set was kept for a fair 3-way model comparison).

## Known limitation, found and corrected: FinBERT domain gap

FinBERT (trained on the Financial PhraseBank — company/investor
statements) initially scored **58.6% of "price up" headlines as
positive** — e.g. *"Onion prices shoot up by 52% in a month"* scored
0.92 positive. In that training domain, rising prices/profits are good
news; for a consumer commodity, they're the opposite of what this
project needs to predict. "Price down" headlines were scored correctly
(89.9% negative), confirming this was a specific, directional gap, not
random noise.

**Fix applied**: a targeted regex identifies price-rise language
co-occurring with the word "price(s)" and swaps the positive/negative
probabilities for those 130 headlines (out of 1,898). Scope
deliberately narrow — output/export-volume language showing the same
ambiguity (e.g. *"Soyabean exports up by 50%"*) was identified but left
uncorrected, since export growth and output growth push commodity
prices in *opposite* directions, and a blanket rule would introduce a
new bug rather than fix this one. Affects ≤2 headlines in the full
dataset — noted, not chased further.

## Known limitation: Wheat has no viable model

At the 5% next-day threshold, Wheat had **11 spike events across its
entire 10-year validated history** (0.39% base rate, vs. 22.5% for
Onion and 7.3% for Soyabean). A chronological test split puts only 3 of
those events in the held-out set — too few for precision/recall/F1 to
be statistically meaningful regardless of model or resampling
technique. All three baselines (Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
XGBoost) predicted zero spikes on Wheat.

**Decision**: keep the 5% threshold and 1-day horizon consistent across
all three commodities (no special-casing Wheat to get a better-looking
number), keep Wheat in the pipeline, and report this as a genuine
finding about Wheat's volatility profile at this market/threshold — not
a missing feature. The dashboard shows Wheat's price/news normally and
an explicit "no viable model" message instead of a fabricated
prediction.

## Result: sentiment mattered less than expected — also a real finding

Random Forest's SHAP importance ranking is dominated by price-derived
features (`rolling_std_7d`, `momentum_7d`, `pct_change_1d`, etc.) for
both Onion and Soyabean. `sentiment_negative_mean` barely enters
Onion's top 10; no sentiment feature appears in Soyabean's top 10 at
all. The FinBERT pipeline was built and validated carefully (including
finding and fixing the domain-gap bug above), and the honest conclusion
is that **it contributes little incremental predictive value over price
data alone** in this project's final models — plausibly because
(a) Onion's real crisis coverage is reactive/coincident with price
moves rather than leading them, and (b) Soyabean's sentiment coverage
is only ~1.7% of trading days. Reported as a finding, not hidden.

## Why Onion underperformed Soyabean despite better data

Counterintuitively, Random Forest scored far better on Soyabean
(F1 0.657, ROC-AUC 0.873) than Onion (F1 0.309, ROC-AUC 0.585), despite
Onion having more news coverage and a higher spike rate. Investigated
directly: Onion's *non-spike* days already average a 6.68% absolute
daily price move — a 5% "spike" barely stands out from routine noise.
Soyabean's non-spike days average only 2.76% — a real spike is a
genuine outlier against a much calmer baseline. Soyabean's spikes are
also more directly foreshadowed by the immediately preceding day's
price move (correlation r=-0.226, vs. Onion's r=-0.072) — confirmed
independently by SHAP, where `pct_change_1d` is Soyabean's single most
important feature.

## Other limitations

- **Headline-only news text** (no article body) — a defensible choice
  for FinBERT specifically (closer to its training distribution than
  full articles), not a workaround for lack of effort.
- **Day-level dates only**, both price and news sources — no intra-day
  timestamps, so same-day ordering between a headline's publish time
  and a price report is not resolvable with this data.
- **XGBoost's `scale_pos_weight` was computed with the standard formula
  and not tuned** — its true ceiling on this data is unknown, only its
  out-of-the-box performance was evaluated.
- **No live data feed.** All dashboard output reflects the fixed
  2013-07-01–2023-06-30 window, not real-time prices or news.
